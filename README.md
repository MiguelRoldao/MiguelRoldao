Hello there! My name's Miguel Rold√£o. I'm a 24 year old undergraduated Electronics and Telecomunications Engineer from Portugal, currently doing a Master's in Informatics.

I love everything related to electronics, computer science, music and fishkeeping.
So I'm glad to get involved in any project related to those topics!

When I'm programing, my language of choice is C, and lua for scripting.
As I usually work on embedded systems projects, I also know my way around assembler.

If you want to contact me, write me an e-mail at miguelroldao@gmail.com
